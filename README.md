# Next.js Runtime Error on '/about' Page

This repository demonstrates a runtime error encountered in a Next.js application when navigating to the '/about' page. The error occurs during the execution of `getServerSideProps` within the `pages/about.js` file.  The issue likely involves the usage of `node-fetch` in a way incompatible with the Next.js server-side rendering environment.

## Bug Description

The application throws a runtime error, typically indicating a problem with the API request or data handling within `getServerSideProps`. The specific error message will vary depending on the nature of the issue.  The root cause is often related to improper handling of asynchronous operations or invalid API responses.

## Solution

The solution involves correctly handling potential errors during the API request and providing more robust error handling within `getServerSideProps`.  The provided solution utilizes try...catch blocks to gracefully handle any exceptions during the fetch process and displays user-friendly error messages.
